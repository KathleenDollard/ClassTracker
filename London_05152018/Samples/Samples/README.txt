Thanks for coming to my talk! 

This code is demo code, so there's no warranty of any kind. None. Nada. Sample code. 

The material in my references slide is really awesome. 

I did a version of the functional with generic inheritance and NDC Oslo 2017. It's 
in the branches of ClassTracker. But I'm rethinking this approach, particularly 
design and naming around RichData.

This material is background for what I want to do to the ClassTracker demo, I just 
keep rethinkng the basics, so am not happy with the current Master branch. If you 
want to work on it, fork it and let me know what you do!  

Enjoy!
